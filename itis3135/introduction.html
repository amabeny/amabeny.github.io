            <ul>
           Personal Background: I am a Junior studying computer science with a concentration of Software Engineering. I am originally from and raised in Greensboro, NC. I moved to Charlotte for school freshman year.
    <section>
           Professional Background: I have years of retail experience but my first relevant experience is from the summer of freshman year when I worked for Black Rocket Instructions and assisted teaching kids coding and technology material. Currently I intern at EPRI as a network engineer and work part-time on campus as a senior TA for the IT Service Desk. 
        </section>

        Academic Background: I started here as a freshman and have been a computer science major since then. I did not know I wanted to do computer science throughout high school until the summer before going to college in 2021.

        Primary Computer Platform: MacOS

<h3>Courses I'm taking and why:</h3>
            <li>ITIS 3135- Web App Design & Dev: I think it's a pretty useful skill for anyone who plans on developing code. Also want to make my own personal portfolio soon.</li>
            <li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Sec. & Privacy: Thought it would be an interesting elective.</li>
            <li>ITIS 3146 - Into to OS. & Networking: I like networks and it is also required for my major.</li>
            <li>MATH 1165  - Intro to Discrete Structures: I don’t like math but it is required for my major.</li>
        </ul>
            Funny/interesting Item to Remember Me by: I used to be a guinea pig mom to 2 pigs named Pluto and Lucky.
            I’d Also Like to Share: I have an interest for UX/UI design so I’m hoping to incorporate my knowledge to web design.
